Many people try to form questions by **memorizing grammar rules**.  
That does not work for long.

Instead, always ask **three simple questions in your mind**:

1. Am I asking about a **state** or an **action**?
2. Is it **present** or **past**?
3. Does the **result matter now** or not?

This decision tree helps you choose the **correct helping verb** logically.

#### Step 1: Decide — State or Action

##### 1️1. Asking about a **State**

A **state** means:
- no action
- only condition, status, or situation

Examples of states:
- availability  
- completion status  
- condition  

##### Present State  
Use: **is / am / are**

Examples:
- Is the server up?  
- Are you free now?

##### Past State  
Use: **was / were**

Examples:
- Was the task completed yesterday?  
- Were you available in the morning?

**Rule:**  
If there is **no action**, do **not** use *do / did / have*.

---

##### 2. Asking about an **Action**

An **action** means:
- something happens
- someone does something

Now decide **time**.

---

#### Step 2: If Action → Decide Time

##### A. Present Actions

###### a) Action happening **now**  
Use: **is / am / are + verb-ing**

Examples:
- Are you working now?  
- Is the deployment running?

Use this when the action is **currently in progress**.

---

###### b) Habit or routine  
Use: **do / does**

Examples:
- Do you work on weekends?  
- Does this service restart automatically?

Use this for **regular or repeated actions**.

---

##### B. Past Actions

Now ask one more question.

---

#### Step 3: For Past Action — Does the Result Matter Now?

###### a) Result **matters now**  
Use: **has / have**

Examples:
- Have you completed the assignment?  
- Has the build finished?

Use this when the **current situation depends on the past action**.

---

###### b) Result **does not matter now**  
Use: **did**

Examples:
- Did you complete the assignment yesterday?  
- Did the server restart last night?

Time is finished; result is not important now.

---

###### c) Action happened **before another past action**  
Use: **had**

Examples:
- Had you completed the task before the meeting started?  
- Had the service failed before the alert came?

This is **past before past**.

---

#### One Golden Rule (Very Important)

**Only ONE helping verb comes in a question.**

Wrong:
- Did you are working?  
- Does the task is completed?

Correct:
- Were you working?  
- Is the task completed?

First decide **state or action**, then choose **only one helping verb**.
