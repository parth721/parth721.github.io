**Modal verbs** are helper verbs used to express **intention, ability, advice, permission, or possibility**.  
Unlike **be** and **have**, modal verbs are **not strongly linked to tense**. They mainly show the **speaker’s attitude**, not time.

Common modal verbs:
- can, could
- will, would
- should
- may, might
- must

### Key characteristics of modal verbs

- They are followed by the **base form of the verb**
- They **do not change** with subject (no *s / es*)
- Time is understood from **context**, not from the modal itself
