What is the efficient debugging way? **reading logs**. Manually testing each options makes things difficult and time-consuming. If we read the logs we get to know why we are receiving such unexpected outcome. Because $$n$$-different factors can lead to same outcome. 

Logs have too much information not all are necessary to understand why we are receiving specific output.

### Steps

1. First answer the question : **What decision did the system make that surprised me?**
2. Ask:
    - **What system produced these logs?**
    - **What subsystems exist inside it?**
    <br>
    example: for a mail synchronization issue we look for
    - `MailSyncWorker` → syncing
    - `MessagingController` → high-level mail logic
    - `NotificationController` → notifications
    - `PushController` → push vs polling
    - `Android WorkManager` → scheduling

3. **List down the events and their timeline (with search)**

    | Time        | What happened               |
    | ----------- | --------------------------- |
    | 07:32:39    | App process starts          |
    | 07:32:39–47 | Background mail sync runs   |
    | ...    |  ...|


4. **Separate signals form noise**
    - Verbs about decisions (**D**)
    - Words like: `start`, `stop`, `clear`, `disable`, `success`, `cancelled`, `no new`, `already present`.
    <br>
    Example signal:

    ```
    7:32:39      Scheduling work ID ... MailSyncWorker
    
    7:32:39      Executing periodic mail sync
    7:32:39      Running command 'checkMail'
    7:32:39      Starting mail check
    7:32:40      Synchronizing account ..
    
    7:32:40      Connecting to imap.gmail.com
    7:32:42      authenticated (Success)
    
    7:32:45      EXAMINE "INBOX"
    7:32:46      Remote message count for folder INBOX is 2
    
    ....
    ```
5. **Track state transition.**
   Build the mental model of the workflow from such logs

   ```sh
   12-24 07:32:47.xxx  8541  8577 D ImapSync: Have 0 unsynced messages
   ```
 

> Ignore the irrelevant logs that are not specific to your issue. like `OEM`, `UI`, `darkmode`, `library loading`, ...

### Breakdown of Log 

```
12-24        → Date (MM-DD)
07:32:47.xxx → Time (HH:MM:SS.milliseconds) — local device time
8541         → Process ID (PID)
8577         → Thread ID (TID)
D            → Log level (DEBUG)
ImapSync     → Component / class emitting the log
Message      → Actual event
```

### Log Levels Reference

| Level | Read when       | Why                    |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| V     | Rarely          | Too detailed           |
| D     | Always          | Real behavior          |
| I     | Always          | Phase confirmation     |
| W     | Carefully       | Unexpected but handled |
| E     | Immediately     | Failure                |
| F     | Drop everything | Crash                  |
