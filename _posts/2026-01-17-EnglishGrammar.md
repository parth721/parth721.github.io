My mother tongue is **Bengali**. During childhood, I learned English mainly through storybooks.

Even now, when I write my brain first forms the sentence in Bengali and then translates it into English. Since **Bengali and English follow different grammar rules**, this direct translation often produces sentences that are understandable but **not always grammatically correct** in English.

I want to fix this problem.  
This blog is my attempt to learn English **logically, step by step**, and to build sentences that are **clear, correct, and natural**.

#### 1. English is an action-based language

English focuses on the **action (verb)** first and then adds details.

A natural English sentence usually follows this order:

- **Who** is doing the action (Subject)
- **What** action is happening (Verb)
- **Who / what** receives the action (Object, if required)
- **How → Where → When** (Details)



#### 2. Level 0: Basic sentence structure

$$Subject + Verb + Object$$

#### Example:
> I read books.

- Subject: I  
- Verb: read  
- Object: books  

⚠️ Not all verbs need an object. This is important.



#### 3. Sentences with **no object** (valid English)

Some verbs **complete the action by themselves**.

#### Examples:
> I sleep.  
> He runs.  
> She arrived late.

These verbs **do not need an object**.



#### 4. Level 1: Adding details (OMPT rule)

After the basic structure, English adds details in this fixed order:

**OMPT**
- **O** → Object  
- **M** → Manner (how)  
- **P** → Place (where)  
- **T** → Time (when)

$$Subject + Verb + Object + Manner + Place + Time$$

#### Example:
> I read books **quietly** **in my room** **at night**.



#### 5. Level 2: Frequency words

Words like:
- always
- usually
- often
- sometimes
- once
- rarely

These come **before the main verb**.

$$Subject + Frequency + Verb + Object + MPT$$

#### Example:
> I **often** read books **quietly** **in my room** **at night**.


#### 6. English sentences always need a **subject**

In English, a sentence **cannot start with only a verb**.

##### Dummy subject “it”

Used for time, weather, and distance:

> It is raining.  
> It is 10 PM.  
> It is very far.

Here, **“it” has no real meaning**, but grammar needs it.



##### Commands (hidden subject)

> Sit down.  
> Open the laptop.

The subject is **“you”**, but it is hidden.



#### 7. Subject–verb agreement (very important)

#### Rule:
- **Singular subject → verb + s / es**
- **Plural subject → base verb**

#### Examples:

> He **writes** code.  
> She **works** daily.  
> They **write** code.  
> We **work** daily.



#### 8. Complex sentences with connectors

Connectors help us join ideas, but English needs **one clear main clause**.

- **Clause :** A sentence with subject & verb but feels in complete.
- **main clause :** can be treated as a  sentence. `E.g: I make grammatical mistakes`
- **dependent clause :** can't be treated as a sentence. `E.g: when I type quickly`

### Example:
> **When** I type quickly, I make grammatical mistakes.

Breakdown:
- **When** → time connector
- **I type sentences** → supporting clause
- **I make grammatical mistakes** → main clause

Without a strong main clause, the sentence feels incomplete.

#### List of connectors :
- when
- once
- because
- if
- although
- while
- so
- but



#### 9. A complete complex example

> I **often** make grammatical mistakes **when I type sentences quickly** **on my phone** **at night**.


#### 10. In/At 

> **Am I talking about a *point* or an *area*?**

- **Point → `at`**
- **Area / inside → `in`** 

#### Example 
- At the office. (to my relative/external member)
- In the office. (to my manager/internal member)

### Final thought

Do not aim for *perfect English*.  
Aim for **controlled English**.

When the structure is clear, correctness follows naturally.

By the end of this section we will learn when to add articles & when not.

**A/An** : If something is general/unknown.
**The** : If something is specific/known.

**⚠️ Special case:** 

If the word shows a **state** or **time** (home, work, now, today, tomorrow, yesterday),
👉 NO ARTICLE

By the end of this section we will learn when to add preposition & when not.

**Preposition :** It is used to define the relationship between words.

| Manner   | Place    |  Time   |  Destination | Purpose |
|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| **by** (transport)   | **in** (inside/involved)   |  **in** (long time)  |  **to** (destination)  |  **for** (purpose)   | 
|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| **with** (tool)   |  **on**  (surface)  |  **on** (day/date)  |  **from** (start point) | **because of** (reason)   |
|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| **in** (condition)   |  **at** (location)  |  **at** (exact time)  |  **into** (move inside) |  **due to**  (formal reason) |
|----|-----|----|----|-----|
|    |     |    | **out of** (move out)  |     |
|----|-----|----|----|-----|
| Travelling by bus. <br> writing with pen. <br> I'm in hurry. |  In a meeting. <br> On the mat. <br> At the office   | In the evening.<br> On tuesday. <br> at 5:00pm.   | to the office. <br> From Agra. <br> Go into room. <br> Go out of stage.   | Study for exam. <br> Because of rain. <br> Due to delay.  |

**⚠️ Special case:**

No preposition is used for **time** or **movement+state**
- now : let's talk now.
- then : Back then, I was a student.
- today : I am busy today.
- yesterday : I call you yesterday.
- tomorrow : let's meet tomorrow.
- go :  go home.
- come : come home early.
- return : return home.
