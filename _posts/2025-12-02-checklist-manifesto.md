Humans by nature flawed & inconsistent creatue; which also make us creative.

There are 2 reasons of Human Error : 
1. **Ignorance :** Don't know about the circumstance.
2. **Ineptitude :** Inability to apply the knowledge in real-life.

Avoidable human error during critical hours is expensive. To reduce these Errors USE **Checklist**.

The purpose of creating checklist : 
1. Safety
2. Consistency
3. Efficiency

- _use the checklist before doing the task & before final submission_
- _it should be short-speedy-concise_
