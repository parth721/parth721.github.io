This is the content of my very first blog post!

I recently started experimenting with Jekyll, choosing the Minima theme because it looked simple. Instead, I spent several hours solving issues I didn’t expect. Here’s a concise record of what I learned.

### Dark Mode Setup

Enabling light/dark mode was harder than anticipated. LLM-generated instructions were inconsistent and often incorrect because they lacked project-specific awareness. The solution came only after carefully reading the official Jekyll documentation.

### File Structure Confusion

Understanding where files belong (_layouts, _includes, _sass, etc.) was initially confusing. Here, LLM tools helped clarify the structure, and the issue was resolved quickly.

### LaTeX Support — The Real Challenge

There was almost no reliable information on enabling LaTeX in Minima. I spent 2–3 hours trying different LLM suggestions and online posts, none successful. Switching themes felt costly after already investing effort.

Eventually, checking GitHub Issues for Minima helped. I found someone who solved the same problem, but their explanation wasn’t immediately clear due to my lack of Jekyll experience. I asked an LLM to interpret the thread in simple terms, followed the steps, and finally got LaTeX working.

### Key Takeaways

-  Real fixes usually come from official docs and GitHub Issues, not random search results or LLM suggestions

- You don’t always need deep understanding of tools like Jekyll for occasional tasks.

- LLMs are useful for clarifying concepts, but unreliable for exact implementation steps.
