<!--When learning English, grammar books often talk about **12 tenses**.  
But in daily life, we do **not** use all of them equally.

In real conversations, emails, and interviews, we mostly use **only 5 tense patterns**.  
If you master these, you can communicate clearly in most situations.



### The 5 most common tenses in daily English

---

#### 1. Simple Present — habits, facts, routines  
**(Used the most)**

Used for:
- daily habits
- general facts
- routines

**Pattern:**  
`Subject + base verb (+ s/es)`

**Examples:**
> I work in an office.  
> I usually wake up at 7.  
> He writes code.



#### 2. Present Continuous — happening now / temporary

Used for:
- actions happening now
- temporary situations

**Pattern:**  
`Subject + am / is / are + verb-ing`

**Examples:**
> I am working right now.  
> She is staying at home today.



#### 3. Simple Past — finished actions

Used for:
- actions completed in the past
- events with finished time

**Pattern:**  
`Subject + V2`

**Examples:**
> I worked yesterday.  
> He called me last night.



#### 4. Present Perfect — past with present relevance

Used for:
- actions completed before now
- results that matter now
- experiences

**Pattern:**  
`Subject + have / has + V3`

**Examples:**
> I have finished my work.  
> I have already eaten.



#### 5. Simple Future — decisions and plans

Used for:
- future decisions
- plans
- promises

**Patterns:**
- `will + base verb`
- `am / is / are + going to + base verb`

**Examples:**
> I will call you later.  
> I am going to meet him tomorrow.



### Tenses that are less common in daily life

#### Past Perfect (`had + V3`)
- Used for “past before past”
- Rare in daily conversation

> I had finished before he arrived. (correct but formal)

Daily version:
> I finished before he arrived.

---

#### Final takeaway

These cover **most real-life English usage**.

When you are comfortable with these, other tenses become easy to understand later.-->



In the previous blogs, we learned:
- how to structure a sentence,
- how articles work,
- how prepositions show time, place, direction, and manner.

Now we answer the most feared question:

> **Which tense should I use?  
> Which verb form (V1, V2, V3) should I choose?**

This blog will fix that **logically**, not by memorization.

---

## One important truth (read this slowly)

> **Tense is decided by time and relevance,  
> not by sentence length or difficulty.**

English mainly asks:
- **When did it happen?**
- **Does the result matter now?**
- **Is it still continuing?**

---

## The only 5 tenses you need first

You do **not** need 12 tenses to speak correct English.

Start with these **5 most common tenses**.

---

### 1. Present Simple — habits and facts

**Use when:**
- the action is regular
- the action is generally true

**Structure:**
- Subject + V1  
- Subject + V1 + s/es (for he/she/it)

**Examples:**
- I study daily.
- She works in an office.
- They play football.
- We eat rice at night.

---

### 2. Present Continuous — happening now

**Use when:**
- the action is happening right now
- the action is temporary

**Structure:**
- Subject + Be-verb (is/am/are) + V1 + ing

**Examples:**
- I am studying now.
- She is working today.
- They are watching TV.

---

### 3. Past Simple — finished in the past

**Use when:**
- the action is completely finished
- the time is past (even if not mentioned)

**Structure:**
- Subject + V2

**Examples:**
- I studied yesterday.
- She joined the company last year.
- We completed the project.

---

### 4. Present Perfect — result matters now

This tense confuses many learners.

**Use when:**
- the action happened in the past
- but the **result is important now**

**Structure:**
- Subject + have/has + V3

**Examples:**
- I have completed my degree.
- She has joined the company.
- We have finished the task.

Think like this:
> The action is past, but the **impact is present**.

---

### 5. Present Perfect Continuous — duration till now

**Use when:**
- the action started in the past
- it is still continuing
- you care about **how long**

**Structure:**
- Subject + have/has been + V1 + ing

**Examples:**
- I have been studying for 3 hours.
- She has been working here since 2022.

---

## Verb forms: V1, V2, V3 (no fear)

Verbs have **three forms**, but you never choose randomly.

| Form | Meaning | Used with |
|----|----|----|
| V1 | base / present | present simple |
| V2 | past | past simple |
| V3 | past participle | have / has / had |

---

### Golden rule (very important)

> **If you see `have`, `has`, or `had`,  
> the verb must be V3.**

No exception at beginner level.

---

## Common verb table (do not memorize in one day)

| V1 | V2 | V3 |
|----|----|----|
| go | went | gone |
| do | did | done |
| make | made | made |
| eat | ate | eaten |
| write | wrote | written |
| read | read | read |
| see | saw | seen |
| take | took | taken |
| come | came | come |
| give | gave | given |

Use this table as a **reference**, not as homework.

## How to choose the correct verb form (step-by-step)

Ask these questions **in order**:

### Step 1: Is the sentence about **now**, **past**, or **habit**?
- habit → Present Simple → V1
- now → Present Continuous → V1 + ing
- past finished → Past Simple → V2

---

### Step 2: Does the result matter **now**?
- yes → Present Perfect → have/has + V3
- no → Past Simple → V2

---

### Step 3: Is duration important?
- yes → Present Perfect Continuous

---

## How to form a full sentence (final recipe)

You already know structure, articles, and prepositions.  
Now combine everything.

### Sentence factory:

1. Subject  
2. Verb (tense decides form)  
3. Object (if needed)  
4. Article (a / the, if noun appears)  
5. Details (manner → place → time)

---

### Example 1

> I **have completed** **the course** **successfully** **at home** **recently**.

---

### Example 2

> She **is preparing** **for the interview** **seriously** **at night**.
