After the invention of television, the medium of knowledge transfer shifted from **text-based** to **picture-based**.  
And it raises a serious question: how seriously should someone be expected to engage in **chart or data analysis on a news channel**, when the system prioritizes **eye-catchy visuals and entertainment** instead of thoughtful information?


> *Neil argues that television is a powerful technology capable of reshaping culture.*


## Purpose of Television
Postman states that the primary function of television in America is not education or public service, but **to gather an audience to be sold to advertisers**.  
Television achieves this best by being **amusing**, regardless of the value or seriousness of the content.

- Television’s job is audience collection, not truth or depth.
- Entertainment becomes the mechanism through which attention is captured.


## Critique of News & Seriousness
Postman critiques the illusion of seriousness in televised news.

- News appears serious, yet is continuously interrupted by commercials.
- The structure makes it difficult to treat news as a meaningful civic activity.
- Newscasters are often selected for **appearance and charisma**, not journalistic expertise.
- Viewers may end up **watching the anchor, not the news**.


## Political Discourse on Television
Postman argues that **political conversations on television are reduced to performances**, not thoughtful argument.

- Complex issues are compressed into extremely short statements and rebuttals.
- Debates function more like **entertainment events** rather than forums for reasoning.
- The format values **style over substance**.


## Impact on Information & Literacy
Despite being surrounded by more information than ever, society is becoming **poorly informed**.

- Television presents a **fragmented world**, built from fast-moving images rather than logical sequences.
- Historical context and complex ideas are difficult to communicate visually.
- If a story has **no dramatic pictures**, it is often ignored.


## The “Now This” Phenomenon
Postman explains that news transitions are intentionally abrupt.

- The phrase **“now this”** disconnects each story from the previous one.
- Audiences are implicitly told to forget what they just heard and move on instantly.
- Serious reading demands continuity—television destroys it.


## Changes in Students & Contradiction
Postman observes a decline in students’ sensitivity to logical contradiction.

- Television and film teach the brain to accept sequences of images without reasoning.
- Stories are consumed without needing to understand logical connection.


## Information Satiation
Postman describes a crisis where **the problem is not lack of information, but overload**.

- People struggle to determine what information is relevant or meaningful.
- Excess data leads to confusion, not clarity.


## Image vs. Discourse in Politics
Television shifts attention from **what is said** to **how it looks**.

- The focus moves from reporting facts and arguments to evaluating image, expression, and charisma.
- Political success becomes tied to **likability**, not agreement or substance.


> **Thinking is not a performing art** — which is why it rarely appears on prime-time television.


### conclusion
Television transforms public discourse into entertainment, weakening seriousness, depth, and rational thinking in news, education, politics, and culture. It rewards appearance over reasoning and creates a society overloaded with information but lacking genuine understanding.
